<h1 align="center">Instabrute</h1>
Instagram brute force tool uses the chromedriver to control a chrome session and automatically login. This is extremely impractical and an update is being worked on where the use of tor helps decrease speeds significantly.

<h1 align="center">Dependencies</h1>
- python
- a c++ compiler (g++, clang, etc)

<h1 align="center">Example</h1>
- run the program by typing "./tool" into the terminal
- next add an instagram username you wish to attack "./tool 'username'" (without the brackets)
- finaly pass a reference to the wordlist.txt file you want to use "./tool 'username' 'wordlist.txt'"
- example:
